When I started college, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the future. It was tricky because I began college during the Covid pandemic, and my first two years were all online. I initially studied Business Management without really knowing what it was. Later, I explored other options and switched to Finance because I found Marketing too easy, and I was interested in real estate.

During my second year, I talked to grads from the University of Hawaii and got inspired to push myself. I finally got to attend classes on campus, which was a big change. Seeing everyone working hard around me motivated me to do the same. So, I decided to major in Finance and thought of adding Marketing as a second major since it seemed easier.

As time passed, I realized I needed internships since many around me had them. I looked for opportunities online and considered banking internships because of my Finance major. But the idea of working in a bank didn't excite me. That's when I discovered Pacxa, a company that seemed forward-looking and interesting. They had two internships available, and although I wasn't too tech-savvy, I applied for an Account Management Intern position that seemed like a good fit.

Surprisingly, I got an interview and the internship. It was a company I really wanted to work for, especially because tech jobs in Hawaii are limited. I've been with Pacxa since then and am now an Associate Account Manager Fellow. They've offered me a full-time job after I graduate, which I'm excited to accept. This internship experience led me to my current path.

At Pacxa, I've learned about different roles they have. I'm in Managed Services now, but I'm aiming to get a Project Manager certification and move into Consulting. I'm also taking a Project Management course to improve my skills. Outside of Pacxa, I worked on a project over the summer with other interns. We set up a server using Microsoft Azure and made a tracking app for a service program. This experience solidified my interest in IT, and that's why I switched my major from Marketing to MIS.

In short, my college journey has been a process of discovery and change. I found direction through my internship at Pacxa and hands-on projects, which showed me where I want to go in the future.
