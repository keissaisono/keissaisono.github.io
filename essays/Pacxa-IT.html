<p>When I started college, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the future. It was tricky because I began college during the Covid pandemic, and my first two years were all online. I initially studied Business Management without really knowing what it was. Later, I explored other options and switched to Finance because I found Marketing too easy, and I was interested in real estate.</p>

<p>During my second year, I talked to grads from the University of Hawaii and got inspired to push myself. I finally got to attend classes on campus, which was a big change. Seeing everyone working hard around me motivated me to do the same. So, I decided to major in Finance and thought of adding Marketing as a second major since it seemed easier.</p>

<p>As time passed, I realized I needed internships since many around me had them. I looked for opportunities online and considered banking internships because of my Finance major. But the idea of working in a bank didn’t excite me. That’s when I discovered Pacxa, a company that seemed forward-looking and interesting. They had two internships available, and although I wasn’t too tech-savvy, I applied for an Account Management Intern position that seemed like a good fit.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I got an interview and the internship. It was a company I really wanted to work for, especially because tech jobs in Hawaii are limited. I’ve been with Pacxa since then and am now an Associate Account Manager Fellow. They’ve offered me a full-time job after I graduate, which I’m excited to accept. This internship experience led me to my current path.</p>

<p>At Pacxa, I’ve learned about different roles they have. I’m in Managed Services now, but I’m aiming to get a Project Manager certification and move into Consulting. I’m also taking a Project Management course to improve my skills. Outside of Pacxa, I worked on a project over the summer with other interns. We set up a server using Microsoft Azure and made a tracking app for a service program. This experience solidified my interest in IT, and that’s why I switched my major from Marketing to MIS.</p>

<p>In short, my college journey has been a process of discovery and change. I found direction through my internship at Pacxa and hands-on projects, which showed me where I want to go in the future.</p>
