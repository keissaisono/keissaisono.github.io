<p>During the WOD 5 assignment, we dove  into the use of variables to improve the display of Smart Phone products in a web application. 
The primary aim is to avoid hard-coding product information and enhance code maintainability. The process begins with duplicating SmartPhoneProducts1 and renaming it to SmartPhoneProducts1_variables. 
Product data, such as names, prices, and image URLs, is stored in JavaScript variables. These variables are then used to dynamically populate product information on the web page.</p>

<p>For more information, view the link below:

<p>While performing the WOD, I thought everything was moving smoothly for the majority of it. I slowed down on the parts where we had to find and replace variables but not in a challenging aspect.
What worked well for me was reading the instructions and watching the screencast prior to performing the WOD. Rather than viewing it for when I was stuck, I had a better idea of the outcome for each 
step. Overall, I found this WOD to be easier than some of the previous ones.</p>

<p>Initially, to prepare for this WOD, I read the instructions, watched the screencast, and if I had any further questions, I would look it up.
Similar to the previous WODs, I sort of walked through it and marked the steps. One thing that I did differently was watching the screencast prior.
I found that this has helped me gain a better understanding on the tasks.</p>

<p>Something that I couldâ€™ve done better was check to see that my audio was recording prior to recording and doing the entire WOD. For the next WOD, I think I want to try incorportating pseudocode 
into the process just to get more used to it and using it as a draft to see if the codes will actually work in the way that I want it to.</p>
